# Cultural Misconceptions
Description: Group project for the ECS521U Interactive Media Design and Production module at QMUL. It was created to dispel cultural misconceptions in a lighthearted, humorous way. The aim was to raise awareness and make a meaningful application instead of one that serves as a means of simply presenting information.
